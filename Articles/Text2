				Transparency of Public Finances 
 
 This dimension refers to the quality and accessibility of public financial information. It 
assesses whether the government provides data about its revenues and expenditures, performs a 
comprehensive budget classification, and publishes its budget and fiscal documentation (PEFA, 
n.d.). The PFM Act makes a significant contribution to the transparency of public financial 
information. In particular, section 21(5) is concerned with the comprehensiveness of budget 
documentation. It provides a list of details that should be included in this documentation, for 
example, the government’s capital and recurrent expenditures, tax expenditures, etc. In addition, the 
PFM Act (2016) improves the transparency of financial information because it requires officials to 
report all sources of funding when disclosing the budget execution. Thus, this Act is likely to 
decrease Ghana’s performance in the dimension of the transparency of public finances. 
       
        Management of Assets and Liabilities
         
This pillar is linked to the government’s assets and debts. It evaluates whether the 
government identifies fiscal risks, records and manages assets, and plans, approves, and monitors 
debts and guarantees (PEFA, n.d.). The PFM Act (2016) provides comprehensive guidelines related 
to the government’s asset and debt management. For example, section 52 appoints the Principal 
Spending Officer accountable for managing, controlling, and recording assets. Section 54 states that 
the Public Debt Management Office should be responsible for managing debts and assessing fiscal 
risks. Sections 55-78 regulate various aspects of debt management, ranging from defining borrowing 
purposes to planning and reporting debts. Given the comprehensiveness of areas of asset and debt 
management, one can conclude that the enforcement of the PFM Act may help Ghana to score high 
in this dimension of the PEFA framework.
