				Conclusion 

To sum up, the PFM Act of 2016 is intended to improve the Ghanaian government’s public 
financial management by including clauses aimed at improving its performance in all seven 
dimensions of the PEFA framework. The Act regulates the management of revenues and 
expenditures, provides guidelines for accounting for funds and audit results and assigns duties and 
responsibilities. One may conclude that if the PFM Act is properly and consistently enforced, it may 
help the government score high in all the PEFA dimensions.
