An Analysis of the Public Financial Management Act 2016 with the PEFA Framework 
In 2016, the parliament of the Republic of Ghana passed the Public Financial Management 
(PFM) Act. The purpose of the Act is to determine the responsibilities of officials accountable for 
managing public finances, improve the effectiveness of financial management, and increase the 
transparency of public funds. This paper aims to analyze the PFM Act in accordance with the PEFA 
framework, which is used to define the weaknesses and strengths of public financial management in 
a particular country. This framework consists of seven pillars: budget reliability, public finance 
transparency, management of assets and liabilities, policy-based budgeting, control and 
predictability in budget execution, accounting and reporting, and external scrutiny and audit (PEFA, 
n.d.). This paper will evaluate the PFM Act in all these seven dimensions to see how this Act 
contributes to the more efficient management of public finances.
