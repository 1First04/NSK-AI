		Accounting and Reporting
 
This dimension is concerned with the quality of financial information generated and 
disseminated by the government. In particular, it assesses the integrity of financial information and a 
variety of financial reports (PEFA, n.d.). The PFM Act (2016) ensures financial data integrity by 
requiring the responsible officials to keep accounts aligned with general accounting principles and 
submit them in a timely manner, as stipulated by section 42. Section 43 requires annual and other 
necessary reports to be submitted within the set timeframe, which ensures that the important 
financial information is delivered at an appropriate time for decision-making. Further, sections 79
82 regulate different types of accounts, providing guidelines about the submission deadlines, 
responsible officials, the content of accounts, as well as the possibility of introducing changes to the 
accounting system. Thus, the PFM Act outlines principles and requirements necessary for the 
government of Ghana to ensure the integrity, timeliness, and comprehensiveness of its financial 
reporting. 

                                External Audit
 
This dimension assesses whether public finances are reviewed by an external auditor. In 
addition, it evaluates whether the government follows the recommendations given to it after an 
external audit to ensure the improvement of any legal issues (PEFA, n.d.). Under section 84 of the 
PFM Act (2016), external audit is the duty of the Auditor-General. It should be conducted within six 
months after a financial year ends. Further, section 85 specifies that a Principal Spending Officer is 
accountable for reporting on the implemented recommendations given after the external audit.
